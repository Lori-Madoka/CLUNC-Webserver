# CLUNC-Webserver
Is a really bad amalgamation of code  that somehow lets you host a server from your (probably linux) machine on a local network, it probably woould work on the internet but I wouldn't go so far as to trust it that much *yet*.
So I really needed to procrastinate and made this for everyone to suffer under.

Main point was to avoid using someone else's code directly (ironic that this is now on here I know)
Should be pretty plug and play, eventually I will add some security stuff to it but that is a not now problem, if  you're looking at this you probably know how to do said security stuff already.


How to use:

- Pray it compiles
- Run it in console so you can see all the lovely error messages

Hopefully it works well-ish for you!
