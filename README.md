# CLUNC-Webserver
Is a really bad amalgamation of code  that somehow lets you host a server from your (probably linux) machine on a local network.
So I really needed to procrastinate and made this for everyone to suffer under.

Main point was to avoid using someone else's code directly (ironic that this is now on here I know)
Should be pretty plug and play, eventually I will add some security stuff to it but that is a not now problem, if  you're looking at this you probably know how to do said security stuff already.



How to use:

- Replace the chroot("PATH_TO_ROOT") with wherever you want ur root directory to be (usually the directory u have the CLUNC in.
- Pray it compiles
- Run it in console so you can see all the lovely error messages


Hopefully it works well-ish for you!
